<!-- I got confused when doing this one. 
    I'll retry next week as I had something similar to use for reading credentials to access a service, 
    and I've been told that credentials must be save and read from a file protected. I'll investigate more on this. 
    I'm attaching another file called work.ts. My question is when reading this 2 variables:
    const xApiKey: string = "500fbdc8A5f34A4b09A8236Aa604dee33fb3";
    const organisation: string = "edfb0e33Ae190A4ad6A8a76A7b1d51e2f87a";
    Do I need to have that store on a local file and read it from there? or it's secure to use it like that? -->
